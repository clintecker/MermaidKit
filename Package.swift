import PackageDescription

// MermaidKit — native Mermaid diagram parsing, layout, and rendering.
// MermaidLayout is platform-free geometry (parse → layout → scene IR + a
// geometric layout linter). MermaidRender draws with CoreGraphics/CoreText on
// Apple platforms, and — WHEN OPTED IN — with Silica (Cairo/FontConfig) on
// Linux. No JavaScript, no WebView.
//
// ── Why the Silica backend is behind a trait (`LinuxRaster`, default OFF) ──
// Silica pins its Cairo/FontConfig stack to `branch: master` (an unstable,
// non-versioned dependency), and SwiftPM forbids a package consumed via a
// stable version tag (`from: "0.x.0"`) from transitively depending on a
// branch/revision: the downstream resolve fails outright with
//   "mermaidkit depends on an unstable-version package 'silica' …".
// That made every tagged MermaidKit release UNCONSUMABLE by a normal
// `from:`-pinned host (this is what stranded Quoin on 0.10.0).
//
// Even when the Silica products were merely platform-conditioned
// (`.when(platforms: [.linux])`), SwiftPM still RESOLVED (fetched) Silica and
// its entire transitive graph — Cairo, FontConfig, plus the PureSwift/Android,
// Kotlin, JavaScriptKit, swift-java and swift-syntax trees — on ALL platforms,
// including macOS/iOS consumers that never link a single Silica symbol.
//
// Package traits (SwiftPM 6.1+) fix BOTH: the Silica dependency and the
// SilicaCairo/Cairo product links are guarded by the `LinuxRaster` trait, which
// is NOT in the default set. A consumer that doesn't opt in gets a graph with
// ZERO Silica/Cairo/branch dependencies — so a stable `from:` resolve is clean
// on every platform, and Apple hosts never drag in the Linux raster stack.
// Linux users who WANT the native raster backend enable the trait, e.g.
//   .package(url: "…/MermaidKit", from: "0.12.0", traits: ["LinuxRaster"])
// or build/test with `--traits LinuxRaster`.
